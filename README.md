## Project Description
### Overview
The project aims to analyze and process ECG signals to extract QRS complexes using R wave Detection algorithms.

### Features
* Signal filtering techniques to remove noise and artifacts from ECG signals.
* Detection of the R wave, a prominent feature in the ECG waveform corresponding to ventricular depolarization.
* Heart rate calculation, arrhythmia detection, and ECG-based diagnostic systems.
