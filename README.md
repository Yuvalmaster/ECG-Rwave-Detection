## Project Description
The project aims to analyze and process physiological signals to extract meaningful information and gain insights into human health and well-being. 
- Rwave Detection of ECG Signals:
The Rwave Detection of ECG Signals project involves the processing and analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. 
The project includes filtering techniques to remove noise and artifacts from the signals, thereby enhancing the accuracy of subsequent analyses. 
The primary focus is on detecting the R wave, a prominent feature in the ECG waveform that corresponds to ventricular depolarization. 
Accurate R wave detection is essential for various applications, including heart rate calculation, arrhythmia detection, and ECG-based diagnostic systems.
